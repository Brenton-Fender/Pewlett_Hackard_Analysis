# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for an incoming increase in retirements. This analysis will highlight the departments that will be most heavily impacted and inform the managers of each department what employees will be eligible for the mentorship program.

## Analysis Findings
- Senior level employees account for 80% of the “silver tsunami.”
- The most heavily effected position is Senior Engineer with 15,045 retirement age employees.
- The Development department has the most retirement aged employees with 9,281. This accounts for over 25% of retirement aged employees.
- Only 4.2% of retirement aged employees are eligible for the mentorship program.

## Impact of the Incoming "Silver Tsunami"
A total of 36,619 employees are set to retire from Pewlett Hackard in the near future. Pewlett Hackard needs to be concerned about the number of Senior level employees in this total.  A total of 29,313 Senior level employees are retirement age; this makes up 80% of Pewlett Hackard's incoming “silver tsunami.”


## Mentorship Program
There are currently 1,549 employees eligible to participate in the employee mentorship program. This is 4.2% of retirement aged employees. I have provided two additional queries to present the breakdown of mentor eligible employees available based on title and department.  The supplementary query shows the lack of Senior Engineers eligible for the mentorship program compared the number retirement aged employees in the same position. There are no Managers eligible for the mentorship program. The Manager positon may not be concern due to the small number(2) of among the "silver tsunami."
